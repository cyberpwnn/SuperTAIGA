Tinkers Alloying Addon (TAIGA)
===============

TAIGA is an addon for Tinkers Construct. It adds new minable ores, new alloys and a bunch of new tinker traits for them.

Included:
 * 16 new meltable Ores with 4 new hardness levels (5,6,7,8)
 * 16 alloys in combination with new molten ores and molten items
 * actual 27 new Traits with random, funny, positive or negative effects
 * two new types of burnable items (e.g. lignite) and a bunch of other alloy-essential items
 * additional Gold and Iron (slagged), for the use in a lot of other mods. Iron is always too rare...
 * some new additional Blocks. Most of them just with an optical use - atm

What's going on?
===
What does the mod add?
* There are 16 kinds of new ores, seperated in 4 categories each: Arcane, solide, ethere and ratio metals.
* You are just able to combine some of them as neigbours in a "circle": Arcane <> Solide <> Ethere <> Ratio <> Arcane - you gonna check JEI for Recipes!
* The hardness of the new tool depends on their parents. Not every alloy is hard enough, to mine the next alloy-level.
* At the moment I am up for ideas for better category-like traits!

How to start?
* Just start how you would usually start with Tinkers Construct. Go out, farm and mine until you find cobalt for high tier tools.
* From that point, you are able to mine harder materials and combine them to new alloys.

Hardness of each new ore in case you gonna ask...
* Low Level: Tiberium, Bismuth
* Cobalt (4): Prometheum, Eternite, Violium
* Titanite (5): Titanite, Rubium, Mythril, Mindorite
* Meteorite (6): Meteorite, Arcanite, Palladium, Karmesine
* Vibranium (7): Vibranium, Ignitite
* Adamantite (8): Adamantite
* It is up to you to find out which alloy you need to get to highest tier.

Balancing, more traits, more alloys, more ores:
* At the moment I have no idea how well balanced my mod is.
* I hope you give me a lot of good feedback, so I can balance it better!!!
* PLEASE send me requests for new traits, ores and alloy-ides. Especially ideas for a better system of my 4 categories!

Where to request or report issues:
* Github, CurseForge or via mail
